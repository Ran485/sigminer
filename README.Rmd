## Overview

The goal of **sigminer** is to provide an uniform interface for genomic variation signature analysis and visualization. **sigminer** is originated from [VSHunter](https://github.com/ShixiangWang/VSHunter) package I wrote. I hate ugly structure and function names in VSHunter, thus reconstruct it using concise function names, S4 classes and S3 methods etc.. I will continue to add more features to uncover genomic variation signatures and their correlationship with phenotypes and genotypes.

**sigminer** is powered by [NMF](https://github.com/renozao/NMF) package and [maftools](https://github.com/PoisonAlien/maftools) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sigminer from Github with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ShixiangWang/sigminer")
```
