Description: Genomic variations including somatic mutations,
    copy number variations, etc. are the major force for cancer
    initialization and development.  Due to the specificity of molecular
    lesions caused by genomic variations, we can generate characteristic
    variation spectra, called 'signature'. This package helps users to
    extract, analyze and visualize signatures from genomic variations,
    thus providing new insight into cancer study.
