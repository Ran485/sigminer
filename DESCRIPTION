Description: Genomic variations including somatic mutations, copy number variations, etc. are the major force
  for cancer initialization and development.
  Due to the specificity of molecular lesions caused by genomic variations, we can generate characteristic
  variation spectra, called 'signature'. This package helps users to extract, analyze and visualize signatures
  from genomic variations, thus providing new insight into cancer study.
